# Text_Scraping_From_Website
This project scrapes text from a website
In this project, I am scraping text from the website https://kissah.org which is a Balochi story-publishing website
The script scrapes the text, tokenizes it into sentences, and saves it in different file formats like .txt, .csv, and .xlsx formats.

The libraries that are used:
BeautifulSoup
Requests
Pandas
and NLTk
